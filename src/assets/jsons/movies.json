      "Rahul-Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.",
      "Roy- slow mo action explosion romance explosion again x men more explosions a deep and intense story followed by more explosions so funny go watch it you won't regret the dirty jokes and explosions will keep you entertained until the end of the 2-hour movie I'd never really paid much attention to Deadpool until now 10 out of 10",
      "Alisha-When Deadpool is good, it's really good. As soon as Ryan Reynolds puts on the red suit, he brings the character of Deadpool to life in a way perhaps no one else could. The film is hilariously entertaining, but it is more that than a good film. I found myself with little care for the story and constantly itching to see more of the real Deadpool, but when you saw him, they were some of the most funny and entertaining scenes in any comic book film to date.",
      "Aravind-This movie created with help Adobe Premier Pro CC . In this film many adult scenes , but many children scenes . In this film there are scenes with SEX . Storyline in this film is amazing and in this movie many special effects . This film is the best Marvel Movie . Amazing Movie . 10/10 . "

      "Veeru- Gridiron Gang was a pleasant surprise. I did not expect to enjoy it, and at times it6 did have some so-so moments, but when you see it, you can see that the film has a driving message of hope, which is the key to the film's success. Far from great, but quite entertaining, the film is an impressive feat for The Rock who is able to deliver a good dramatic performance here. Although never too original, this is an interesting twist on a football film, and like I said it's got a good message, which plenty of viewers can get behind and appreciate. A fine mix of performances and a good screenplay rounds out the film to make this a film not to miss, and even for people that are skeptical about such films; Gridiron Gang has something for everyone and it is a well acted, directed film that is far better than many other films in the genre",
      "Harpreet-This is without a doubt my absolute favorite sports movie of all time. It had fantastic acting, an inspirational story, and some of the best sports quotes out there and fantastic character development. The main reason people want to see this movie will be because of Dwayne the Johnson, and I can tell you guys that he certainly does not dissapoint. His performance as coach of the Mustangs was the bescoach portrayel I've seen since Buttermaker from Bad News Bears. It was emotional, and realistic. However, If Dwayne gets my lead for best performance in the movie, Jade Yorker get's a close second as Willie Weathers, a former 88 gang member who shot his heavily abusive father after he tried to hit his mother, and ends up as running back for the Mustangs. He was my favorite character, and I found myself cheering for him all the way. The story is great to. It is about a former NFL player turned coach named Sean Porter, who organizes a high scholl football team out of slightly misunderstood gangsters serving time at a youth correctional facility. The lesson is 'Not everyone get's a second chance, so use it well' and what a lesson it is. The football action was pretty good too. Bottom line, this is the best football and sports movie I have ever seen, period."

      "Vineet-The acting performances were also good but not great. Denzel Washington gave a very good performance but not Oscar worthy, it felt like I have seen this before from him. Russell Crowe just was not given the room to actually act. I wish Crowe would have been given more of an opportunity to show off his talent. Josh Brolin gave the best performance as a corrupt police officer. He displayed perfectly the corrupt cop blackmailing both sides for the benefit of himself. I do not really understand the Oscar nomination for Ruby Dee playing Frank Lucas mother. She barley even had a cameo in this movie. It is kind of sad to see how far Cuba Gooding Jr. has fallen not having much of a role in this movie.",
      "Anupreet-What really kept this movie up and kind of brought it down was its steady flow and writing. It did show you some interesting things such as going to Vietnam and having a very unique and surprising place to smuggle in the drugs. Yet as I mentioned before the performances were good but not great because of the writing. I attribute this to the writing. Some of the writing did not allow some of the actors to expand as much as they could have on their roles.",
      "Shawn-Also the directing was very good but not great. Ridley Scott did show some interesting scenes and had good camera shot. The cinematography was good as well. Yet because the performances were not to great that brings him down because his job to guide arguably two of the best actors today."

      "Wesley- We have a film that has done the unthinkable: made a gazillion dollars despite a convincing argument that it puts full blame on its own audience for what it has become.",
      "Christopher- You don't go to the fourth Jurassic Park movie for up-to-date gender politics. You go for the crunchy dino-on-human action, and Jurassic World provides plenty of that.",
      "Rose- Taken entirely on its own merits, Jurassic World is big and exciting and well-paced, the tension is wisely doled out so that action and disaster never feel far away, and once the... really starts to hit the fan, the movie fully comes into its own."

      "Shane- I was finding it incredibly hard to stay awake through this movie. Even the action scenes were quite lacklustre. I think it had nothing to do with the big budget special effects but more to do with the emotionless performance of Daniel Craig's James Bond. Whenever anything exciting happened he acted like he didn't even care. He may do this every day but I can't believe it would ever get old or boring. In between the action scenes there were intense periods of nothingness. It's not surprising really as there was no real plot. I just cannot watch a mindless film about fighting, explosions and getting laid when there's no passion.",
      "Rohit- This is the worst Bond movie ever, filled with emotionless characters that I couldn't care less about. The pace of this film after a predictably exciting start is slow and boring. Unlike his fellow actors, Ben Whishaw as Q manages to portray the only believable human in this whole fake production. Why couldn't JB have been given a touch of Q's wit, humour or vulnerability? No wonder Daniel Craig wants out of this franchise - it's beneath his talent. Such a cacophony of totally forgettable dialogue, people and silly stunts is hard to imagine in a single movie and yet here it is. During one of the 'action' fights when James was being hammered by the evil assassin I noticed the person next to me had fallen asleep and was snoring. That person was an exceedingly eloquent critic.",
